# Doing Business North America

The Doing Business North America (DBNA) project annually provides objective measures of the scale and scope of business regulations in 130 cities across 92 states, provinces, and federal districts of the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.

It uses these measures to score and rank cities in regard to how easy or difficult it is to set up, operate, and shut down a business.

Visit our [website](https://dbna.asu.edu) to explore how your city compares to others across North America, and [contact us](https://dbna.asu.edu/contact) if you have any questions.

### Goals

- Provide objective measurements of regulatory conditions and make them publicly-available to researchers and policymakers.
- Track the improvement or decline in local regulatory conditions and provide a context for thinking about policy reform.
- Contribute to understanding which regulatory environments can produce the best economic outcomes for the largest number of people.

### Methodology

The complete methodology for the 2020 Report (including steps on how to collect the data) is currently being populated to the [DBNA Wiki](https://github.com/PaulBernert/DBNA/wiki). In the meantime, an explanation of the 2019 Report's methodology can be found [here](https://dbna.asu.edu/methodology).
