# DBNA
The Doing Business North America (DBNA) project annually provides objective measures of the scale and scope of business regulations in 115 cities across 92 states, provinces, and federal districts of the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. It uses these measures to score and rank cities in regard to how easy or difficult it is to set up, operate, and shut down a business.
