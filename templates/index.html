          <h2 id="research-objectives">Research Objectives</h2>

            <p>This project aims to take the <a href="https://github.com/PaulBernert/DBNA/blob/master/_data/2020-report/data_with_msas.csv">raw data</a>
              provided from the Doing Business North America report, calculate a rank and score to determine the <em>&#39;Ease of Doing Business&#39;</em>
              (see the <a href="https://github.com/PaulBernert/DBNA/wiki/Ease-of-Doing-Business-Methodology">Methodology</a> for explanation of what Ease
              of Doing Business measures). The effectiveness of the ranking/scoring process will be tested in an applied setting--using the calculated
              <em>&#39;Ease of Doing Business&#39;</em> ranks to see if it correlates with business activity relative to the local population. </p>

            <p>Another primary goal of the project is to use Machine Learning algorithms (through Scikit-learn) to test multiple clustering algorithms
              to see which locations are the most similar in nature. The two clustering algorithms to be tested are KMeans and Affinity Propagation.
              After comparing these two clustering structures, the next step is to test the relationship between clusters and the <em>&#39;Ease of Doing
                Business&#39;</em> ranks to see if there clusters are formed around ranks (whether ranks are a good representative of how locations are
                clustered).</p>

            <p>These tests were chosen not only to test the effectiveness of the data-set in an analytical environment, but to also see whether
              regulatory burdens truly have an impact on business starts.</p>

          <h2 id="about-the-project">About the Project</h2>

            <p>The Doing Business North America (DBNA) project annually provides objective measures of the scale and scope of business regulations
              in 130 cities across 92 states, provinces, and federal districts of the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It uses these measures to
              score and rank cities in regard to how easy or difficult it is to set up, operate, and shut down a business. </p>

            <p>Over the years, researchers have begun to understand how robust measurement and ranking of regulations that either enhance business
              activity or constrain it can provide substantial insight into economic outcomes. Objective measurements of those regulations have been
              vital in this understanding. Unlike many studies that measure regulations at the state level, this annual study measures the impact at
              the city level and does so for over 100 municipal jurisdictions across North America.</p>

            <p>The Doing Business North America team collected data on 63 different regulatory and economic indicators across six different categories.
              The data collected came entirely from official and publicly-available sources.</p>

          <h2 id="about-the-data">About the Data</h2>

            <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaulBernert/DBNA/master/images/categories.PNG"/></p>

            <p>This project manually collects data on primary regulatory burdens businesses face throughout the entire life-cycle of a business, ranging
              from Starting a Business to eventually Resolving Insolvency if the business were to shut down / go bankrupt. The report contains data on
              63 regulatory indicators within the following six categories:</p>

              <ol>

                <li>Starting a Business</li>

                <li>Employing Workers</li>

                <li>Getting Electricity</li>

                <li>Paying Taxes</li>

                <li>Land and Space Use</li>

                <li>Resolving Insolvency</li>

              </ol>

            <p>These six categories are then combined to create a catch-all value known as the <em>&#39;Ease of Doing Business&#39;</em>.
              This is the value used in all analysis for this project.</p>
